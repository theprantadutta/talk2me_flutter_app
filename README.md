## Technologies Used

* **Flutter:** For building the cross-platform mobile application.
* **Dart:** Programming language for Flutter.
* **Firebase:** Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS)
    * **Firebase Authentication:** For user sign-up, sign-in (Email/Password, Google).

    * **Firebase Storage (Optional):** Could be used for storing media attachments in messages (not implemented in the current scope).
* **State Management:** (Specify your chosen solution, e.g., Provider, Riverpod, BLoC. If none explicitly set up yet, you can omit or mention Flutter's built-in `StatefulWidget`/`setState`).

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

* Flutter SDK (latest stable version recommended)
* An IDE like Android Studio or VS Code with Flutter plugins.
* A Firebase project set up.

### Firebase Configuration

1.  **Create a Firebase Project:** Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Register Your App:**
    * Add an Android app to your Firebase project:
        * Use your app's package name (e.g., `com.example.talk2me_flutter_app`).
        * Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app/` directory.
        * Follow the instructions to add Firebase SDKs to your Android project (usually involves modifying `build.gradle` files).
    * Add an iOS app to your Firebase project:
        * Use your app's iOS bundle ID.
        * Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file and add it to your Xcode project (usually via Xcode, placing it in the `ios/Runner/` directory).
3.  **Enable Authentication Methods:**
    * In the Firebase Console, go to "Authentication" -> "Sign-in method".
    * Enable "Email/Password" and "Google" sign-in providers.
    * For Google Sign-In on Android, ensure you add your SHA-1 fingerprint to the Firebase project settings. You can get it using:
        ```bash
        cd android
        ./gradlew signingReport
        ```
4.  **Set up Cloud Firestore:**
    * In the Firebase Console, go to "Firestore Database".
    * Create a database. Start in **test mode** for initial development (allows open read/write access).
        ```
        // Example Firestore rules for testing (NOT FOR PRODUCTION)
        rules_version = '2';
        service cloud.firestore {
          match /databases/{database}/documents {
            match /{document=**} {
              allow read, write: if true;
            }
          }
        }
        ```
    * **Important:** For production, you MUST set up proper security rules to protect your data (e.g., only authenticated users can read/write their own data or chats they are part of).

### Local Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository (if applicable):**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd talk2me_flutter_app
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
3.  **Ensure Assets:**
    * Make sure you have the `assets/logo.png` and `assets/images/chat_bg.png` files in the correct locations.
    * Update your `pubspec.yaml` to include the assets folder:
    ```yaml
    flutter:
      uses-material-design: true
      assets:
        - assets/
        - assets/images/
    ```
    Then run `flutter pub get` again if you modified `pubspec.yaml`.

## Running the Application

1.  **Connect a Device or Start an Emulator/Simulator.**
2.  **Run the App:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

## Future Enhancements (Possible To-Do)

* **Media Sharing:** Allow users to send images, videos, or other files.
* **Message Reactions:** Add emoji reactions to messages.
* **Advanced User Profiles:** More detailed user profiles with status messages, etc.
* **Push Notifications:** Implement Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) for background notifications.
* **End-to-End Encryption (Advanced):** For enhanced privacy.
* **Message Deletion/Editing:** Allow users to delete or edit their sent messages.
* **More Robust Error Handling and UI Feedback.**
